# Movie-Recommendation-using-Cosine-Similarity
This project involves developing a movie recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. 
The system suggests movies to users based on the similarity of their favorite movies to other movies in the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to extract relevant features.          
Feature Extraction: Combines features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director into a single string for each movie.          
Vectorization: Converts the text data into feature vectors using TF-IDF Vectorizer.                          
Similarity Calculation: Calculates similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity.                           
Recommendation Generation: Based on the similarity scores, generates a list of recommended movies for a given favorite movie input by the user.
